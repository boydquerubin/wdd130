      <p>
        My name is Boyd Querubin. I am a Filipino, an Irish citizen and an
        <br />
        American citizen. I graduated with a Communications Degree from BYUI
        <br />
        back in 2021 and worked in Marketing for 4 years, but I've decided to<br />
        have a career change and now I'm back in school studying Software <br />
        Development. My favorite football team is Tottenham Hotspur Football<br />
        Club, they play in the Premier League. In my spare time, I like to
        code,<br />
        listen to podcasts, play video games, watch movies/anime, play<br />
        volleyball and spend time with my wife and kids.

      <p>
        Idaho is a northwestern U.S. state known for mountainous landscapes, and
        vast swaths of protected wilderness and outdoor recreation areas. The
        capital, Boise, is set in the Rocky Mountain foothills and is bisected
        by the Boise River, which is popular for rafting and fishing. The city’s
        riverfront Julia Davis Park is a downtown green space containing a rose
        garden, museums and a zoo.
